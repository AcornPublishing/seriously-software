# Seriously Good Software
## Source files

These are the source files for the book ["Seriously Good Software"](https://www.manning.com/books/seriously-good-software), published by Manning.

This repository is self-contained (dependencies included).
You can compile it from the command line or import it in your IDE (Eclipse project file is included).

You need at least **Java 9** to compile this project.

Most source files are different versions of the same `Container` class.
So, they are all called `Container` but sit in different packages.
For example, `eis.chapter2.reference.Container` is the reference (baseline) version.

Some classes with a "main" method:

 * `eis.ReflectiveUseCase` runs the standard use case on all compatible container versions (you must compile those versions first)
 * `eis.chapter2.reference.UseCase` runs the standard use case on `eis.chapter2.reference.Container`
 * all other `UseCase` classes in various packages

Other fun things to try:

 * Run _jUnit_ on `eis.chapter6.UnitTests`. From the command line (in /src):
 
     `javac -cp .:../libs/junit-4.12.jar eis/chapter6/UnitTests.java`  
     `java  -cp .:../libs/junit-4.12.jar:../libs/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore eis.chapter6.UnitTests`

 * Run code coverage tool _jacoco_ on `eis.chapter6.UnitTests` and obtain an HTML report. From the command line (in /src):
 
     1. Collect info:

        `java -javaagent:../libs/jacocoagent.jar -cp .:../libs/junit-4.12.jar:../libs/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore eis.chapter6.UnitTests`  

     2. Generate the report in the "coverage" folder:

        `java -jar ../libs/jacococli.jar report jacoco.exec --classfiles . --sourcefiles . --html ../coverage/`
